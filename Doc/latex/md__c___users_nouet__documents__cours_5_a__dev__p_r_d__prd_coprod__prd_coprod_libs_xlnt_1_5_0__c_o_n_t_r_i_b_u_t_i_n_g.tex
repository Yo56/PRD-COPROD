Look through the list of issues to find something interesting to work on. Help is appreciated with any issues, but important timely issues are labeled as \char`\"{}help wanted\char`\"{}. Issues labeled \char`\"{}docs\char`\"{} might be good for those who want to contribute without having to know too much C++. You might also find something that the code is missing without an associated issue. That\textquotesingle{}s fine to work on to, but it might be best to make an issue first in case someone else is working on it.\hypertarget{md__c___users_nouet__documents__cours_5_a__dev__p_r_d__prd_coprod__prd_coprod_libs_xlnt_1_5_0__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Contributions}\label{md__c___users_nouet__documents__cours_5_a__dev__p_r_d__prd_coprod__prd_coprod_libs_xlnt_1_5_0__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md10}
Contributions to xlnt should be made in the form of pull requests on Git\+Hub. Each pull request will be reviewed and either merged into the current development branch or given feedback for changes that would be required to do so.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Branch from the head of the current development branch. Until version 1.\+0 is released, this the master branch.
\item Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.\+e. each commit should compile and pass all tests). Commits that don\textquotesingle{}t follow the coding style indicated in .clang-\/format (e.\+g. indentation) are less likely to be accepted until they are fixed.
\item If your pull request is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can -\/reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.
\item Add tests relevant to the fixed defect or new feature. It\textquotesingle{}s best to do this before making any changes, make sure that the tests fail, then make changes ensuring that it ultimately passes the tests (i.\+e. TDD). xlnt uses cxxtest for testing. Tests are contained in a tests directory inside each module (e.\+g. source/workbook/tests/test\+\_\+workbook.\+hpp) in the form of a header file. Each test is a separate function with a name that starts like \char`\"{}test\+\_\+\char`\"{}. See \href{http://cxxtest.com/guide.html}{\texttt{ http\+://cxxtest.\+com/guide.\+html}} for information about Cxx\+Test or take a look at existing tests.
