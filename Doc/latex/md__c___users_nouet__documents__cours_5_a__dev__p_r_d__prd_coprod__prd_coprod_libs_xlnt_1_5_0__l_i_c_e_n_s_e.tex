\DoxyCodeLine{the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public}
\DoxyCodeLine{License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  0. Additional Definitions.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  As used herein, "{}this License"{} refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License, and the "{}GNU GPL"{} refers to version 3 of the GNU}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}The Library"{} refers to a covered work governed by this License,}
\DoxyCodeLine{other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  An "{}Application"{} is any work that makes use of an interface provided}
\DoxyCodeLine{by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode}
\DoxyCodeLine{of using an interface provided by the Library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  A "{}Combined Work"{} is a work produced by combining or linking an}
\DoxyCodeLine{Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library}
\DoxyCodeLine{with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "{}Linked}
\DoxyCodeLine{Version"{}.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The "{}Minimal Corresponding Source"{} for a Combined Work means the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code}
\DoxyCodeLine{for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are}
\DoxyCodeLine{based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The "{}Corresponding Application Code"{} for a Combined Work means the}
\DoxyCodeLine{object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data}
\DoxyCodeLine{and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License}
\DoxyCodeLine{without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  2. Conveying Modified Versions.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a}
\DoxyCodeLine{facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application}
\DoxyCodeLine{that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the}
\DoxyCodeLine{facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified}
\DoxyCodeLine{version:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to}
\DoxyCodeLine{   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs}
\DoxyCodeLine{   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of}
\DoxyCodeLine{   this License applicable to that copy.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from}
\DoxyCodeLine{a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object}
\DoxyCodeLine{code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated}
\DoxyCodeLine{material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure}
\DoxyCodeLine{layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates}
\DoxyCodeLine{(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are}
\DoxyCodeLine{   covered by this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license}
\DoxyCodeLine{   document.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  4. Combined Works.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,}
\DoxyCodeLine{taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse}
\DoxyCodeLine{engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of}
\DoxyCodeLine{the following:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that}
\DoxyCodeLine{   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are}
\DoxyCodeLine{   covered by this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license}
\DoxyCodeLine{   document.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during}
\DoxyCodeLine{   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among}
\DoxyCodeLine{   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   d) Do one of the following:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this}
\DoxyCodeLine{       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form}
\DoxyCodeLine{       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to}
\DoxyCodeLine{       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of}
\DoxyCodeLine{       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the}
\DoxyCodeLine{       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying}
\DoxyCodeLine{       Corresponding Source.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the}
\DoxyCodeLine{       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time}
\DoxyCodeLine{       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer}
\DoxyCodeLine{       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version}
\DoxyCodeLine{       of the Library that is interface-\/compatible with the Linked}
\DoxyCodeLine{       Version.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise}
\DoxyCodeLine{   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is}
\DoxyCodeLine{   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If}
\DoxyCodeLine{   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany}
\DoxyCodeLine{   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation}
\DoxyCodeLine{   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL}
\DoxyCodeLine{   for conveying Corresponding Source.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  5. Combined Libraries.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library side by side in a single library together with other library}
\DoxyCodeLine{facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this}
\DoxyCodeLine{License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your}
\DoxyCodeLine{choice, if you do both of the following:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based}
\DoxyCodeLine{   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,}
\DoxyCodeLine{   conveyed under the terms of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it}
\DoxyCodeLine{   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the}
\DoxyCodeLine{   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions}
\DoxyCodeLine{of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new}
\DoxyCodeLine{versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may}
\DoxyCodeLine{differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version}
\DoxyCodeLine{of the GNU Lesser General Public License "{}or any later version"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and}
\DoxyCodeLine{conditions either of that published version or of any later version}
\DoxyCodeLine{published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you}
\DoxyCodeLine{received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide}
\DoxyCodeLine{whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall}
\DoxyCodeLine{apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is}
\DoxyCodeLine{permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library.}
